# MEMO - Vision-First AI Desktop Companion

**MEMO** (Memory & Environmental Monitoring Observer) is an intelligent, vision-based desktop companion designed to enhance productivity, health, and spatial awareness. It transforms your standard webcam or mobile phone camera into a smart observer that tracks objects, monitors your posture, guards your focus, and recognizes you.

Built with **YOLOv8**, **FaceNet**, and **OpenCV**, MEMO runs entirely locally on your machine, ensuring privacy and speed.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 **Spatial Memory & Querying**
MEMO "remembers" where it saw objects on your desk.
- **"Where is my bottle?"** → *"The bottle is currently on the left, seen just now."*
- **"Do you see my wallet?"** → *"Yes, I see the wallet."*
- Supports fuzzy matching and synonyms (e.g., "phone" = "cell phone").

### 👤 **Face Recognition & Greeting**
MEMO knows who you are.
- **Personalized Greetings**: *"Hello Jayadeep. Welcome back."*
- **Privacy-First**: Face embeddings are stored locally (`user_embedding.npy`) and never uploaded.
- **Smart Re-Greeting**: Only greets you again if you've been away for a while.

### 📵 **Smart Focus Mode**
Need to get work done? Tell MEMO to guard your focus.
- **Command**: `focus on`
- **Behavior**: If MEMO sees a cell phone in the frame, it verbally scolds you: *"Put the phone away and focus on your work!"*
- **Visuals**: Bounding boxes turn RED when threats (phones) are detected.

### 🧘 **Health & Posture Coach**
MEMO watches out for your physical well-being.
- **Proximity Alert**: If you lean too close to the screen (>55% frame width), it warns: *"You are too close to the screen. Please move back."*
- **Sedentary Alert**: Tracks how long you've been sitting. If > 60 minutes, it reminds you to stretch.
